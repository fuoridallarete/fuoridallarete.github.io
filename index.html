		    	<p>Hi there! My name is Sabrina and I come from Sardinia, it almost makes a rhyming couplets so it's quite easy to remember!</p> I am a 31 years old human being who loves technologies and coding, despite coming from a different background of study. </p>    	
	    		<p>I graduated in Rome in International Political Science, field that at that time really interested and passionated me. It still does, actually, but I felt that was not the right path for me. I then moved to London and there I've been living for six years, untill just now.</p>
	    		<p>In this beautiful city I somehow discovered the world of coding and I just felt in love with it. I've been studying mostly self-taught for a while now, trying to find a balance in between this new passion and my everyday life, made of its ups and downs and a full-time work that allowed me to live in da city and travel, the other thing I love a lot. It just keeps me alive.</p> 
	    	    <p>I found out about, I bet, pretty much every online resource untill I found you guys, and I am so glad I did. It happened after I already have attended a short week-end course in Front-End Web Development, which didn't turn out the best choice for me at that time. I couldn't cope with studying and the full-time work schedule that allowed to pay for it, furthermore the support there has not been one of the best for a newbee like me.</p>
	    	    <p>I didn't have the immediate career shift I was looking for, but still I learned a lot from it and menage to get an internship for few months, in which I could practice the new skills and also learned a few more on my own.</p> 
	    	    <p>I built some web sites using mainly HTML5, CSS3 and some basics javaScript, with and without the help of frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation and jQuery. Please have a look at <a href="theflucs.com">my web site</a> if you wish to see some of my works.</p>
	    	    <p>I've learned about CMS like Wordpress, and  enrolled for computer science and programming online courses. I wanted to know more and a bit deeper about this new field in order to fulfill my eager of learning and at the same time fill the gap of my background of study.</p>
	    	    <p>For financial and personal reasons I couldn't apply to your course earlier, but I worked hard to have the chance to do it. And finally here I am!</p>

			    <h2>Why me? <span>//</span> Why not me?</h2>
			    <p>I am self-motivated and curious by nature. I always look for that feeling of working hard that always pays you back, despite the difficulties and the failures one may face on his path. I like to see them as a way of improvement rather than discouragement, and always an opportunity to leave the comfort zone that never gives you the chance of growing and finding new, different and, most of the times, better solutions.</p>
			    <p>I love the idea behind your organization and the principles on which I understand it's based: free education, team-work and give-back.</p><p>That's also why I am applying now that I feel ready to fully committ myself for the whole time of the course and beyond that, hoping this is just the first step of a longer collaboration, which would allow me to become a full-stack professional web developer, able to actively partecipate and contribute to the community.
			    </p>
			    <p>I wish to attend the course in Nazareth so to combine my two main passions, coding and travelling. I am excited about the idea of living in there and have a true insight of the Middle-East places and culture. They always fascinated me.</p><p><p>So far, I've mostly worked on my own and I think now it's time for me to get involved more, so sharing this experience and collaboratively working everyday with other international students is yet another plus that pushes me to do my best to meet your criteria and get this amazing and rare opportunity you offer.</p>
